 The first two cases (Titanic and Bike count) are used to illustrate some essential core concepts of Pandas DataFrames:
 * filter/slice (position, label and boolean based)
 * mutate (new columns, adapting columns, adapting content based on filter)
 * groupby (do operations on a group level)
 * time-indices and resample/rolling (make adjustments on a temporatl scale)
 * reshape (stack, unstack, pivot,...)


 The other case studies are organised on thematic level, focusing on some fundamental and essential concepts. The focus for these cases is on solving the data-cleaning and handling problem.
